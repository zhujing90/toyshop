Most of your commenters will be interested in your newsletter as well. This plugin makes it extremely easie for them to subscribe to your mailinglist. With the sign-up checkbox, all they have to do is check it and the plugin will subscribe them to your mailinglist.

= Sign-up forms =
Easily configure a sign-up form and show it in various places on your website using the sign-up form widget, the `[nsu_form]` shortcode or the `nsu_form()` template function. 

You can set your own messages and even choose to redirect the visitor to a certain page after signing-up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin adds various sign-up methods to your WordPress website, like a sign-up checkbox at your comment form and a sign-up form to show in various places like your posts, pages and widget areas.

= What is the shortcode to display a sign-up form in my posts or pages? =

`[nsu_form]`

= Where can I get the form action of my sign-up form? =

Look at the source code of your sign-up form and check for `<form action="http://www.yourmailinglist.com/signup?a=asd123"...`. The action attribute is what you need here.

= Where can I get the email identifier of my sign-up form? =

Take a look at the source code of your sign-up form and look for the input field for the email address. You'll need the `name` attribute of this input field, eg: `<input type="text" name="emailid"....`

= Can I let my users subscribe with their name too? =

Yes. Just provide your name identifier (finding it is much like the email identifier) and the plugin will add the users' name to the sign-up request.

= Can I show a sign-up form by calling a function in my template files? =

Yes, use the following code snippet in your theme files to display a sign-up form.

`if(function_exists('nsu_form')) nsu_form();`
